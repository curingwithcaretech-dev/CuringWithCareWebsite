                Cancer is a mutation-driven disease, leading to the possibility of traveling infinite different paths from start to
                finish. Originated from cells and capable of influencing the entire body, the rapid expansion leads to missed or
                complicated diagnoses that harm patients. Although cancer is essentially simple, we still misunderstand the true
                actions that get cancer going. The complexity of each individual tumor, although pushing new forms of treatment, brings
                about astonishing space to recourse and address. At CARE, we introduce and expand on the questions behind its life and
                the patients affected by it.
